    <h2>About me!</h2>

    <p>&lsquo;Hello! I'm Jeevika, and my journey has been nothing short of a thrilling adventure. I was born and raised in the vibrant and culturally rich region of Punjab, India.</p>

    <p>However, in December 2022, I embarked on a new chapter by moving to Canada. Upon arriving in Canada, I enrolled in a one-year business course at Conestoga College. It was an immersive experience, and I gained valuable insights into the dynamic world of business management. The diverse cultural landscape of Canada added a unique flavor to my learning journey, broadening my horizons and enriching my perspective.</p>

    <p>I completed my business course and followed my passion for creativity and multimedia. I am continuing my studies in the Multimedia Communications course at Yukon University. This program is helping me delve into the fascinating world of multimedia, providing me with the skills and knowledge needed in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

    <p>My journey reflects a pursuit of academic excellence and a personal quest for growth and self-discovery. The transition from Punjab to Canada has been a remarkable experience, shaping my worldview and giving me a deeper understanding of diverse cultures.</p>

    <p>As I navigate through my studies at Yukon University, I am excited about the opportunities. My blend of Indian roots and global experiences will empower me to contribute meaningfully to multimedia communications.</p>

    <p>My story is one of determination, cultural exploration, and a commitment to continuous learning. Moving from Punjab to Canada has been a transformative experience, and I am eagerly embracing the challenges and opportunities that come my way. Here's to the next chapter of my journey!</p>
